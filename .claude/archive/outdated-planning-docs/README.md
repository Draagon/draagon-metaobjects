# Archived Planning Documents

## Purpose
These documents have been archived because they contain outdated planning and analysis information that could confuse future Claude sessions. The current architecture and build system information is now comprehensively documented in the main `.claude/CLAUDE.md` file.

## Archived Files (2025-09-21)

### 1. COMPREHENSIVE_CONSTRAINT_SPECIFICATION.md
- **Purpose**: Detailed 882-line analysis of constraint system architecture
- **Status**: Pre-implementation analysis document  
- **Why Archived**: Constraint system has been implemented and unified. Current status documented in main CLAUDE.md
- **Replacement**: See "Constraint System Unification (v6.0.0+)" section in CLAUDE.md

### 2. IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md  
- **Purpose**: Implementation plan for unified MetaData registry architecture
- **Status**: Planning document for registry unification work
- **Why Archived**: Some work completed, but approach may have evolved. Could cause confusion about current state
- **Replacement**: See "Self-Registration Pattern (v5.2.0+)" and build system insights in CLAUDE.md

### 3. UNIFIED_REGISTRY_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md
- **Purpose**: Plan for simplifying dual MetaDataTypeRegistry pattern
- **Status**: Acknowledges some v6.0.0+ work completed but proposes additional changes  
- **Why Archived**: Current architecture working well as documented in main CLAUDE.md
- **Replacement**: See build system insights and architectural principles in CLAUDE.md

## Current Documentation
For up-to-date architectural information, constraint system status, and build system insights, refer to:
- **Primary**: `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - Comprehensive, current guide
- **Architecture**: `.claude/architectural-summary.md` - High-level overview
- **Enhancements**: `.claude/ENHANCEMENTS.md` - Prioritized improvement tasks

## Historical Value
These documents are preserved for historical reference and contain detailed analysis that may be useful for understanding the evolution of the MetaObjects framework architecture.
